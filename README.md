Before we get to the point of all that packet sniffing goodness... a word of warning
from the people who actually did all the work.

# WARNING

The scripts in this repo may damage your hardware and may void your hardwareâ€™s warranty! 
You use these scripts and the tools from https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon at your own risk and responsibility! 
If you don't like these terms, don't use nexmon!
If you don't like these terms, don't run any of the scripts in this repo.

# SECOND WARNING

Seriously, use of these scripts in this RaspPiNexmonScripts Repo could brick your raspberry pi and render it useless.
The scrits in this Repo automate the work done at https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon who also warn that your hardware
could suffer irreperable and permenent damage.

Only carry on if you take full responsibility.

I have only automated the RasPi steps described in detail at https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon


# RaspPiNexmonScripts for Kernel 4.14 only.

## Raspberry Pi, set built in chip to monitor mode. (Pi-Zero W, Pi-3B and Pi-3B+)

The good people at the following link, the nexmon project have instructions to 
compile a modified driver to unlock the onboard wifi chip on the raspberry pi.

https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon

### Script:  WiFiCardModDriver.sh

run as root

	sudo ./WiFiCardModDriver.sh

I've automated that process with a script that you can run on the following RasPi models

-Pi Zero W (Hardware revision 9000c1)
 Note: You must have a second WiFi dongle attached to connect you to the internet.

-Pi Model 3B (Hardware revision a02082, a22082  & a32082)

-Pi Model 3B+ (Hardware revision a020d3)


The script will detect and build the modified driver for the above models.

The script will backup the origional hardware driver from location,

    /lib/modules/4.14.79-v7+/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/brcmfmac.ko
    
to

    /lib/modules/4.14.79-v7+/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/brcmfmac.ko.bkp
   
You can confirm the location of the default hardware using the following command in a shell,
the first line of the output will confirm the location of the default reboot driver. The script
does this automatically.

	modinfo brcmfmac

For board revision history information, you might like to check the following link,

https://elinux.org/RPi_HardwareHistory#Board_Revision_History

#### To findout what raspberry pi hardware you are running using the bash command line

    cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'Revision' | cut -d : -f2 | xargs

xargs conveniently truncates the white spaces around the result.

#### QUICK START: TRY YOUR AWSOME SNIFFER IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS 

Here are some commands to get you going, to test if the new driver works.

1) Install tcpdump if you have not already.

	   sudo apt-get install tcpdump

2) SKIP THIS STEP IF YOU HAVE NOT CONNECTED ANY EXTRA USB WIFI DONGLES
	
	  If you have connected an extra wifi USB dongle, the wlan0
	  interface name will randomly change. You can either keep and
	  eye out for the internal wifi chip by using iwconfig, or more 
	  conveniently set predictable network interface names using

	   sudo raspi-config

	  select networking, then select enable on predictive naming.
          WARNING: YOU WILL BE ASKED TO RESET.  DO THIS BEFORE CONTINUING.

3) Set up monitor mode on your wireless card, wlan0.

	   sudo iw phy `iw dev wlan0 info | gawk '/wiphy/ {printf "phy" $2}'` interface add wlan0mon type monitor

4) Activate monitor mode in the firmware.

           sudo ifconfig wlan0mon up

5) Start snuiffing WiFi packets.

	   sudo tcpdump -i wlan0mon
	
 
You should see a whole lot of wifi data streaming down your screen.
This is the very basic setup, you can now go and explore. Have fun!
	  
NOTE: To connect to regular access points you have to execute 

	nexutil -m0 first
	
NOTE: It is possible to connect to an access point or run your own access point in parallel to the monitor mode interface on the wlan0 interface


## Airsniffing Software

### Script:  AircrackNgFromSource.sh

run as root

	sudo ./AircrackNgFromSource.sh

This installs Aircrack-ng from a stable release at https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng/releases
You may change the URL in the script if a later version is available.

#### QUICK START: RUN A QUICK TEST OF YOUR AIRCRACK-NG

After you have run the install script AircrackNgFromSource.sh you can be up and running very quickly.

Here are some commands to get you going, to test if the new driver works.
		
							

												   
   1) SKIP THIS STEP IF YOU HAVE NOT CONNECTED ANY EXTRA USB WIFI DONGLES

	   If you have connected an extra wifi USB dongle, the wlan0 
	   interface name will randomly change. You can either keep an
	   eye out for the internal wifi chip by using iwconfig, or more
	   conveniently set predictable network interface names using

	   	sudo raspi-config

	   select networking, then select enable on predictive naming.
           WARNING: YOU WILL BE ASKED TO RESET.  DO THIS BEFORE CONTINUING.
	
   2)  Setup monitor mode on wlan0, or whatever name is pointing to your onboard chip.

	    There are two commands you can use,

	      the origional,

	       C1)  sudo iw phy `iw dev wlan0 info | gawk '/wiphy/ {printf "phy" $2}'` interface add wlan0mon type monitor

	      but even better, aircrack-ng provides the following command.

	       C2) airmon-ng start wlan0
												   				 
   3) Activate monitor mode in the firmware.

  		sudo ifconfig wlan0mon up
	
   4) Start snuiffing WiFi packets.
			
	  	sudo airodump-ng -i wlan0mon
