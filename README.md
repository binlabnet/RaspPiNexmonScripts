You use these scripts and the tools from https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon at your own risk and responsibility!

If you don't like these terms, don't run any of the scripts in this repo.

# SECOND WARNING

Seriously, use of these scripts could brick your raspberry pi and render it useless.
Only carry on if you take full responsibility.

I have only automated the RasPi steps described in detail at https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon


# RaspPiNexmonScripts for Kernel 4.14 only.

## Raspberry Pi, set built in chip to monitor mode. (Pi-Zero W, Pi-3B and Pi-3B+)

The good people at the following link, the nexmon project have instructions to 
compile a modified driver to unlock the onboard wifi chip on the raspberry pi.

https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon

### Script:  WiFiCardModDriver.sh

I've automated that process with a script that you can run on the following RasPi models

-Pi Zero W (Hardware revision 9000c1)

-Pi Model 3B (Hardware revision a02082, a22082  & a32082)

-Pi Model 3B+ (Hardware revision a020d3)


The script will detect and build the modified driver for the above models.
The script will backup the origional hardware driver from location, 
/lib/modules/4.14.79-v7+/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/brcmfmac.ko
to
/lib/modules/4.14.79-v7+/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/brcmfmac.ko.bkp

RUN AS ROOT
